# Introduction

This is a collection of Rock-Paper-Scissors game. The 1.0 release being worked towards right now is quite modest: it will just be a simple console application that allows for one round of play against a computer opponent. This is more just to build momentum and get a proof of concept in place than anything else.

In later releases, I'm hoping to build both web and Android versions of the game. These would be built on top of a central web service, to allow for networked play.

In addition, it would also be interesting to explore AI-only tournaments, similar to [RPSContest.com](http://www.rpscontest.com/).


# Inspiration

Credit for the idea goes to [RPSContest.com](http://www.rpscontest.com/), which I first came across in the following Reddit post: [My three-line rock, paper, scissors bot has done surprisingly well...](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1nj3z6/my_threeline_rock_paper_scissors_bot_has_done/). If I do get into the AI-only tournaments space with this project, I'm thinking that a differentiator/selling point will be the JVM's multi-language support, rather than just the Python support that version has.

This is obviously not the world's most serious of projects. It's really meant to be a fun excuse to write some silly code. Given my current employer's rather stringent non-compete policy, it's actually a selling point (for me) that it's so more-or-less pointless.
