Work Log

*Tracking Progress on the RPS Tourney Project*


## Introduction

This log just tracks my daily progress on the project. I'm hopeful that this will be a better mechanism for keeping myself motivated than trying to ensure daily commits, which ends up causing odd work-in-progress commits. That's bad practice.

This file should never be committed along with other files; it should always be updated by itself. This will prevent any weird merge problems.
